One possibility is that attackers may target systems during off-peak hours when fewer personnel are monitoring, exploiting potential gaps in coverage. Another reason might be automated attacks that follow predictable schedules or are triggered by external events (e.g., coordinated global attacks).\n",

            "  - **Flexible Response Team Availability:** Ensure the security response team is on standby or has flexible working hours during high-risk periods to minimize response times to security incidents.\n",
            "  - **Regular Threat Intelligence Updates:** Keep abreast of global threat trends and patterns to anticipate and prepare for possible coordinated attacks. Adjust defenses and strategies accordingly to counter emerging threats effectively.\n",
            "  - **Simulation Exercises:** Conduct regular simulated attacks during peak threat hours to test the effectiveness of the current security posture, response protocols, and team readiness, allowing for continuous improvement.\n"
